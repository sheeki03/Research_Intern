  "IDO": "No",
  "IDO_Rationale": "The project mentions openness to a public round but has not confirmed specific details, timelines, or commitments for an IDO. No concrete information on token sale structure or exchange listings is provided.",
  "Investment": "Yes",
  "Investment_Rationale": "BlockMesh demonstrates a clear DePIN model with 700K+ nodes, AI-driven optimization, and Solana scalability. The team has relevant expertise, a 12-month runway, and revenue projections targeting $1M by 2026. The tokenomics include deflationary mechanisms and enterprise data licensing, which create potential value accrual.",
  "Advisory": "No",
  "Advisory_Rationale": "No notable advisors or institutional backing are disclosed in the provided information, which could impact credibility and network effects.",
  "BullCase": "Strong DePIN adoption (700K nodes), AI-driven data monetization, Solana's scalability, enterprise data licensing pipeline, and a deflationary token model with buy-back/burn mechanisms. The team has a track record in blockchain and data infrastructure.",
  "BearCase": "Unclear competitive differentiation against Web2 data providers, reliance on node growth for revenue, potential regulatory risks in data collection, and unproven enterprise adoption. The $10M-$15M valuation may be optimistic given early-stage revenue.",
  "Conviction": "BullCase",
  "Comments": "BlockMesh presents a compelling DePIN opportunity with tangible infrastructure and revenue potential, but risks around scalability, regulation, and market adoption require careful monitoring. The project warrants investment with caution."
